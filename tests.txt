PROXY PROGRAM CONNECTIONS

General comment: 
Manually verify operations succeed by reading output messages.

Log level: LOG_DEBUG
Config file: 1.yaml

[proxy1AB]
Given:  comms up; A up; B down
Show:   reconnect repeat starts on A
Repeat: swap A/B

[proxy2AB]
Given:  comms up; A up; wait for reconn repeat; B up
Show:   reconnect repeat starts on A, then connects to B; sync succeeds
Repeat: swap A/B

[proxy3AB]
Given:  comms up; A up; B up quickly
Show:   B connects to A before reconnect sequence starts
Repeat: swap A/B

CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT/RECOVERY
=================================

General comment:
Test that user program connections can connect and disconnect properly.

Log level: LOG_DEBUG
User programs:
- clnt1 (interactive): nc ADDR PORT
- clnt2 (send file): nc -q 0 ADDR PORT < INFILE > OUTFILE
- serv1 (interactive, single client): nc -l PORT
- serv2 (echo, multi client): tcpserver ADDR PORT cat

[estab2]
Given:  comms up; A & B up; serv1 up; clnt1 up; kill clnt1
Show:   A sends LC_NEW, B recvs; A sends LC_EOD; B recvs, closes
        conn to serv1; B sends LC_EOD & LC_CLOSED_WR; A recvs LC_EOD, closes
        conn to clnt1; A recvs LC_CLOSED_WR, ignores
