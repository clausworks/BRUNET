General comment: 
Manually verify operations succeed by reading output messages.

Config file: 1.yaml

[proxy1AB]

CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT/RECOVERY
=================================

General comment:
Test that user program connections can connect and disconnect properly.

Log level: LOG_DEBUG
User programs:
- clnt1 (interactive): nc ADDR PORT
- clnt2 (send file): nc -q 0 ADDR PORT < INFILE > OUTFILE
- serv1 (interactive, single client): nc -l PORT
- serv2 (echo, multi client): tcpserver ADDR PORT cat

COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS
======================
Note: each test should be performed while toggle_wlan0.sh is running (2s down,
2s up).
